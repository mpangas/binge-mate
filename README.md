# BingeMate - [Live Site](https://bingemate.netlify.app/)

Say goodbye to endless scrolling

## Description

BingeMate is a platform for finding the best movies and TV shows based on your favorite watches. From the home page, users can navigate to the movie or TV show tool which allows them to search from The Movie Database (TMDB) and find recommendations based on their movie or TV show of choice. After selecting a movie or show, users will be presented with the best matches and given information such as title, rating, year, poster, and the ability to click the image to see a randomly selected YouTube video related to the movie.
